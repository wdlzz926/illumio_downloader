1. installation
    request module is needed, can be installed by
    pip install request

2. usage
    python3 downloader.py url -c nThreads

3. design choice
    Using multithread to dowanload file in multiple chunk concurrently.
    Checking status code from first head request to see if the url is invalid
    The bottle neck will be the disk IO speed and the network connection.
    Network disconnection is detected by checking the content-length of response. 
    If it does not match, maximum of 3 retries will be performed.
    This version is not that scalable since for large file, computer memory needed for storing that temporarily is huge.
